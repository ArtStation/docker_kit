- kit status should show the list of services and their status, with ability to select & view logs

- kit attach should list available deployments/pods, and ask for specific container if it has multiple containers
- add kit logs support, should work similar to kit attach
- allow deploying only services enabled for specific configuration
- find a way to always deploy some service, e.g. for migrations and env_files
